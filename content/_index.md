Hello! I am an undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Utah. I work as a research assistant in the Department of Physics and Astronomy studying critical phenomena in the collapse of black holes using computational methods and Numerical Relativity. I have also completed research in the School of Computing on the formal verification of operating systems.
